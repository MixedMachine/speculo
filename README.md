## Description
Speculo is an application that is intended to be used as a mirror to yourself. You can use it to go over your core values, your strengths, your weaknesses, good and bad qualities, your goals, tasks, and daily routines. It is intended to be used as a tool to help you become a better person. It is also intended to be used as a tool to help you become more productive and to help you achieve your goals.

## TODOs
- [ ] Add the Core section
  - [ ] Add Strengths card
  - [ ] Add Weaknesses card
  - [ ] Add Good Qualities card
  - [ ] Add Bad Qualities card
- [ ] Add Routines section*
  - [ ] The ability to add groups of tasks
      - i.e. a group called `morning` that has the tasks `brush teeth`, `shower`, `eat breakfast`, etc.
      or a group called `work` that has the tasks `check email`, `check slack`, `check github`, etc.

\* *The difference between the "tasks" section and the "routine" section is that the tasks section is for one-off tasks that you want to do, and the routines section is for groups of tasks that you want to do consistently to build habits.*
